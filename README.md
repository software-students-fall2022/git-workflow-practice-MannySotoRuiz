As so many things today are becoming digitalized, security is more important than ever.
Just like many other technologies, digitzlied data brings convenience to our lives but it also makes it more vulnerable.
From this article, I was surprised that such confidential data was breached but that it was on the Amazon AWS for such a long time, open to the public. The most shocking part is that the person who found this had a hard time correcting it as many officials were negligent about the information when handed to them. With stronger data management systems emerge, there has to be even stronger security.
