Back in 2015, someone unknown had access to the personal information of 93.4 million Mexican voters due to a MongoDB configuration error. This unknown person uploaded the database on Amazon's AWS. This caused the database to be exposed to the public for a mininum of eight days until it was finally discovered a researcher called Chris Vickery. After several attemps of trying to report this issue, he was finally able to reach the Mexican Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) and they were to have the databse taken offline. Even after investigation, it is still unknown who got access to the databse and uploaded it.

It's interesting to see how easily personal information can be leaked when stored online. In this case, it only took a misconfigured database. This is why companies/governments should invest more into security.

What I found interesting was how such a small error can have such a detrimental effect. more than 93 million people's lives were made public because of of this oversight.

As so many things today are becoming digitalized, security is more important than ever.
Just like many other technologies, digitzlied data brings convenience to our lives but it also makes it more vulnerable.
From this article, I was surprised that such confidential data was breached but that it was on the Amazon AWS for such a long time, open to the public. The most shocking part is that the person who found this had a hard time correcting it as many officials were negligent about the information when handed to them. With stronger data management systems emerge, there has to be even stronger security.
